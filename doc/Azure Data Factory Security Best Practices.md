# üåü Azure Data Factory Security Best Practices  
*Pipelines with Protection*  

---  

## üéØ **Objective**  
Secure data integration workflows and ETL pipelines while maintaining compliance. Designed for data engineers, architects, and security teams managing sensitive data workloads.  

---  

## üîë **Core Security Practices**  

### üîí **1. Identity & Access Management**  
**Why It Matters**: Overprivileged service accounts are a leading cause of data breaches in ETL pipelines.  

**Key Actions**:  
- **Azure AD Integration**  
  - Authenticate pipelines using managed identities instead of shared keys.  
  ```powershell
  # Assign ADF managed identity to SQL DB
  New-AzSqlDbDataMaskingRule -ResourceGroupName "RG" -ServerName "sql-server" -DatabaseName "DB" -ManagedIdentity
  ```  
- **RBAC Granularity**  
  - Limit roles to `Data Factory Contributor` (deploy) and `Data Pipeline Operator` (run).  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Audit existing ADF roles with `az role assignment list --assignee <adf-name>`.  
2. Replace account keys with managed identities for linked services.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A healthcare analytics team prevented unauthorized EHR data access by restricting pipeline permissions to specific Azure AD groups.*

### üåê **2. Network Security**  
**Why It Matters**: Public-facing pipelines risk data exfiltration via MITM attacks.  

**Key Tools**:  
| Tool                | Use Case                          |  
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| **Private Endpoints** | Connect to Azure SQL/Storage privately |  
| **VNet Integration** | Isolate data flows within virtual networks |  
| **NSG Rules**        | Block non-Azure IPs from triggering pipelines |  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Enable private endpoints for all source/sink data stores.  
2. Restrict ADF triggers to corporate IP ranges.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A financial firm stopped a credential-stuffing attack by moving their ADF runtime to a VNet with NSG IP whitelisting.*

### üõ†Ô∏è **3. Data Protection**  
**Why It Matters**: 34% of data breaches involve unprotected cloud storage (Verizon 2023).  

**Key Strategies**:  
- **Azure Key Vault Integration**  
  - Store connection strings and credentials securely:  
  ```json
  // Linked Service configuration
  {
    "type": "AzureKeyVault",
    "typeProperties": {
      "baseUrl": "https://<vault-name>.vault.azure.net"
    }
  }
  ```  
- **Encryption-in-Transit**  
  - Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all data movement activities.  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Audit linked services for plaintext secrets.  
2. Enable "Enforce Encryption" in copy activity settings.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*An e-commerce company achieved GDPR compliance by encrypting PII fields using Key Vault-backed keys before loading into Synapse.*  

---  

### üöÄ **4. Pipeline Governance**  
**Why It Matters**: Unauthorized pipeline changes can introduce data leakage risks.  

**Key Actions**:  
- **Azure Policy Enforcement**  
  - Block unapproved regions or public network access:  
  ```bash
  az policy assignment create --name "adf-audit-privatelink" --policy <policy-id> --params '{ "effect": "deny" }'
  ```  
- **Git Integration**  
  - Require pull requests and code reviews for pipeline deployments.  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Enable Git CI/CD for ADF.  
2. Apply policies to audit pipelines without Key Vault references.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A logistics company prevented a misconfigured pipeline from exposing shipping data by enforcing Git-based peer reviews.*  

---  

### üìä **5. Monitoring & Threat Detection**  
**Why It Matters**: Detect anomalies like 3AM pipeline runs copying TBs of data.  

**Key Tools**:  
- **Azure Monitor Alerts**  
  - Trigger alerts for failed authentication attempts or data volume spikes.  
- **Sentinel Integration**  
  ```kusto
  // KQL query for suspicious copy activities
  ADFActivityLogs
  | where OperationName == "Copy" and BytesWritten > 1000000000
  | project TimeGenerated, UserAgent, SourceType, DestinationType
  ```  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Enable diagnostic settings for ADF to stream logs to Sentinel.  
2. Create a baseline of "normal" data movement volumes.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A media company detected insider data theft by alerting on abnormal data exports to unapproved storage accounts.*  

---  

## üöÄ **Implementation Roadmap**  
1. **Week 1**: Migrate to managed identities + Key Vault.  
2. **Week 2**: Deploy private endpoints and VNet isolation.  
3. **Week 3-4**: Enable Git governance and Sentinel monitoring.
