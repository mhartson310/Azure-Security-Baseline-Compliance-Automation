# 🌟 Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Security Best Practices  
*Containerize with Confidence*  

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
Secure containerized workloads in AKS while enabling scalable, cloud-native architectures. Designed for DevOps teams, architects, and security engineers managing Kubernetes environments.  

---

## 🔑 **Core Security Practices**  

### 🔒 **1. Cluster Access Control**  
**Why It Matters**: Unauthorized cluster access can lead to data breaches or malicious pod deployments.  

**Key Actions**:  
- **Azure AD Integration**  
  - Authenticate users/groups with Kubernetes RBAC.  
  ```bash
  az aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <RG> --enable-aad
  ```
- **Role-Based Access (RBAC)**  
  - Assign least-privilege roles like `azure-aks-reader` or `namespace-admin`.  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Audit current kubeconfig permissions with `kubectl get roles --all-namespaces`.  
2. Replace static admin credentials with AAD groups.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A logistics company prevented lateral movement attacks by limiting `cluster-admin` access to 3 senior engineers.*

### 🌐 **2. Network Policies**  
**Why It Matters**: Unrestricted pod communication exposes workloads to internal threats.  

**Key Tools**:  
| Tool                | Use Case                          |  
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| **Calico**          | Define pod-to-pod traffic rules    |  
| **Azure NSGs**      | Block external traffic to nodes   |  
| **Private Clusters**| Disable public API server access  |  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Enable network policies during cluster creation:  
  ```bash
  az aks create --network-plugin azure --network-policy calico
  ```  
2. Restrict API server to corporate IP ranges.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*An e-commerce platform blocked cryptojacking by denying outbound traffic to mining pools via Calico policies.*

### 🛠️ **3. Container Security**  
**Why It Matters**: 94% of containers have vulnerabilities (Sysdig 2023).  

**Key Actions**:  
- **Azure Defender for Containers**  
  - Scan images in ACR for CVEs during CI/CD.  
  ```yaml
  # Add to pipeline
  - task: AzureContainerRegistry@1
    inputs:
      command: scan
      imageName: "$(IMAGE_TAG)"
  ```  
- **Runtime Policies**  
  - Block privileged pods or hostPath mounts.  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Enable Defender for Containers in Azure Security Center.  
2. Add image scanning to deployment pipelines.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A healthcare provider blocked 12 critical vulnerabilities in Node.js base images pre-deployment.*  

---

### 🚀 **4. Secrets Management**  
**Why It Matters**: Hardcoded secrets in YAML files are a top attack vector.  

**Key Strategies**:  
- **Azure Key Vault Integration**  
  - Mount secrets as volumes using Secrets Store CSI Driver.  
  ```yaml
  # Pod spec snippet
  volumes:
    - name: secrets-store
      csi:
        driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
        readOnly: true
        volumeAttributes:
          secretProviderClass: "azure-kv-secrets"
  ```  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Migrate 1-2 non-critical secrets to Key Vault.  
2. Audit existing deployments for plaintext credentials.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A fintech startup eliminated 200+ exposed secrets by migrating to Key Vault-backed secrets.*  

---

### 📊 **5. Monitoring & Threat Detection**  
**Why It Matters**: Detect cryptomining, anomalous scaling, or data exfiltration.  

**Key Tools**:  
- **Azure Monitor for Containers**  
  - Track pod CPU/memory spikes and failed login attempts.  
- **Prometheus Alerts**  
  - Trigger alerts for suspicious activity like `pod_deleted_total > 5/min`.  

**Where to Start**:  
1. Enable Container Insights:  
  ```bash
  az aks enable-addons -a monitoring -n <clusterName> -g <RG>
  ```  
2. Create alerts for `UnauthorizedAccessAttempts`.  

**Real-World Scenario**:  
*A media company detected a compromised pod exfiltrating data via unexpected outbound traffic to Russia.*  

---

## 🚀 **Implementation Roadmap**  
1. **Week 1**: Lock down cluster access (AAD + RBAC).  
2. **Week 2**: Implement network policies and private clusters.  
3. **Week 3-4**: Roll out image scanning and Key Vault integration.
