# Business Case Proof of Concept Worksheet
## Azure Security Baseline & Compliance Automation

### 1. Project Summary
- **Title:** Azure Security Baseline & Compliance Automation Implementation
- **Description:** This proof-of-concept demonstrates how to establish a secure baseline and automate compliance remediation in Azure using Azure Policy, playbooks, and ARM templates.
- **Goals:** 
  - Improve overall security posture.
  - Automate compliance monitoring and remediation.
  - Reduce manual remediation efforts.
- **Stakeholders:** IT Security Team, Compliance Officers, Cloud Architects, Operations

### 2. Objectives
- Establish a comprehensive security baseline for Azure resources.
- Automate compliance checks and remediation for standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, etc.).
- Enhance monitoring and reporting for continuous compliance.

### 3. Requirements
- Access to Azure Portal, Log Analytics, and Azure Policy.
- Appropriate Azure subscriptions and resource groups.
- Integration with SIEM tools like Azure Sentinel.

### 4. Proposed Solution
- Deploy a security baseline checklist and compliance automation using Azure Policy.
- Utilize playbooks and ARM templates for automated remediation of non-compliant resources.
- Establish continuous monitoring with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.

### 5. Risks and Mitigation
- **Implementation Complexity:** Pilot in a controlled environment and iterate.
- **Integration Challenges:** Coordinate with IT operations and test extensively.
- **Cost Overruns:** Monitor resource usage and adjust deployment as needed.
- **Policy Conflicts:** Test policies in staging before production rollout.

### 6. Expected Benefits
- Enhanced security and reduced risk of breaches.
- Continuous compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Reduced manual remediation and lower operational overhead.
- Improved visibility and faster incident response.

### 7. Estimated Costs
- **Initial Costs:** Development, testing, and pilot deployment.
- **Ongoing Costs:** Azure Policy enforcement, monitoring, and maintenance.
- **Additional Costs:** Licensing, if applicable, and integration with SIEM tools.

### 8. ROI & Metrics
- **Metrics:** Reduction in security incidents, improved compliance audit scores, time savings.
- **ROI:** Cost savings from lower incident response and reduced manual remediation efforts.
- **Payback Period:** Estimated 6â€“12 months.

### 9. Timeline
- **Phase 1:** Planning & Requirements (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Development & Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3:** Pilot Deployment (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Full Rollout & Monitoring (4 weeks)

### 10. Next Steps
