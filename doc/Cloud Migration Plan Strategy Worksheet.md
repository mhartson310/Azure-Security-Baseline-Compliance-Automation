# Cloud Migration Plan/Strategy Worksheet

## Introduction

This worksheet guides you through planning a cloud migration, covering inventory, strategy, dependencies, risks, timelines, and budgets. It’s designed to ensure a smooth transition from on-premises or another cloud to your target cloud provider.

**Examples and Resources**:  
- Examples include *“CRM App, depends on SQL DB, contains PII, High priority”* or *“Web Server, 16GB RAM, 2 instances”*.  
- Leverage tools like [AWS Migration Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/), [Azure Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-migrate/), or [NIST SP 800-30](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final) for risk management guidance.  

**Customization**:  
Fork this worksheet on GitHub to tailor it to your workloads, hybrid setups, or specific cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Add sections like “Serverless Migration” or adjust timelines as needed.

## Additional Guidance for Maximizing This Worksheet

- **Collaborate**: Involve app owners, network admins, and security teams for a comprehensive inventory.  
- **Validate Early**: Double-check dependencies and compatibility to avoid surprises mid-migration.  
- **Test Thoroughly**: Use dry runs or pilot migrations to identify risks before full rollout.  
- **Monitor Costs**: Leverage cloud cost management tools (e.g., Azure Cost Management) to stay on budget.  
- **Prioritize Risks**: Address high-impact risks (e.g., data loss) first with robust mitigation plans.  
- **Iterate**: Update this worksheet as you progress—add new apps or adjust timelines as needed.  
- **Leverage Tools**: Use provider-specific tools like Azure Migrate for automated discovery and planning.  
- **Document Progress**: Track status in the Milestones table to keep stakeholders aligned.

**Next Steps**:  
Share this on GitHub and customize it for your migration. Fork it to add your own apps, risks, or phases—contributions welcome!
